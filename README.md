React Fundamental Concepts Used in This Project:

    •	React Components: Functional components to render UI elements.
    •	JSX: JavaScript XML to describe what the UI should look like.
    •	State Management: `useState` for managing component-level states.
    •	Effect Hook: `useEffect` for side effects like setting the document title.
    •	Context API: Used for global state management across components (cart, wishlist, purchase history).
    •	React Router: For navigation between pages like Home, Dashboard, Statistics, and History.
    •	Conditional Rendering: Dynamically rendering elements based on state (e.g., showing modal or no cart items).
    •	Dynamic Data Binding: Displaying data like products and cart information dynamically using state.

Data Handling and Management –

    •	Context API: Used for managing and sharing global state such as the cart, wishlist, and purchase history across multiple components.
