Project Name: Gadget Heaven

Description: This React-based e-commerce website allows users to browse products, view detailed product information, add items to their cart, manage wishlists, and proceed to checkout. The project uses React Router for seamless navigation, Toastify for in-app notifications, and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. State management is handled efficiently using `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` hooks, enabling smooth interaction across the application.

React Fundamental Concepts Used in This Project:

    • React Components: Functional components to render UI elements.
    • JSX: JavaScript XML to describe what the UI should look like.
    • State Management: `useState` for managing component-level states.
    • Effect Hook: `useEffect` for side effects like setting the document title.
    • Context API: Used for global state management across components (cart, wishlist, purchase history).
    • React Router: For navigation between pages like Home, Dashboard, Statistics, and History.
    • Conditional Rendering: Dynamically rendering elements based on state (e.g., showing modal or no cart items).
    • Dynamic Data Binding: Displaying data like products and cart information dynamically using state.

Data Handling and Management –

    • Context API: To provide a global state for the cart, wishlist, and user data, allowing state sharing across components without prop drilling.

5 Key Features of the Project:

    1. Cart Management: Users can add and remove items from the cart, and the total cost is automatically updated.
    2. Wishlist Functionality: Users can add products to their Wishlist.
    3. Purchase History: After a successful purchase, users can view their purchase history.
    4. Sorting by Price: Users can sort items in their cart by price, from high to low, using a sort button.
    5. Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
